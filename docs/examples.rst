Here are some examples of how to use the library. They all assume that you have already declared a :code:`Fabman` object:

.. code:: python

    # Import the Fabman class
    from fabman import Fabman

    # Define your API key:
    API_KEY = "abcdef-123456"

    # Instantiate a new Fabman object:
    f = Fabman(API_KEY)
