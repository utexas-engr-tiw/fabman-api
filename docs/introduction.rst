Introduction
============

This python package provides a simple wrapper interface around the Fabman API endpoints and response objects. It is intended to be used by Fabman customers to integrate their own software with their Fabman accounts. While this library provides an interface, familiarity of the Fabman API is assumed. You can read more about the Fabman API at https://github.com/FabmanHQ/fabman-api and interact with the live documentation at https://fabman.io/api/v1/documentation.
